        <h1>Emanuel Dobra</h1>
        <p>Preferred name: Emanuel</p>
        <p>I was born in Roumania, and have been living in Canada for the past 14 years.
            I have dabbled in multiple programming languages such as python, c#, java, js, and so on, but solely at the beginner level.
            I am currently taking the CPA program in order to learn the fundamentals required for a programming
            carrer, and am hoping to learn all the necessary skills by the end of the program.
